# OpenRAN-based Traffic Steering
Welcome to the UCLAB Open-RAN repository!

## Overview
This repository provides a sample implementation of **traffic steering** based on **Open-RAN** architecture.  
The goal is to dynamically redistribute network traffic across multiple cells (or DUs) to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) and resource utilization.

## Features
- **Dynamic Steering Algorithm**: Automatically adjusts traffic load based on real-time cell utilization.
- **QoS-Aware**: Monitors throughput, latency, or other KPIs to steer traffic where needed.
- **Extensible Design**: Can be integrated with O-RAN SC (Near-RT RIC, rApps) or other OpenRAN components.
